### source-code

## Description

This project showcases the implementation of a built-in function across multiple programming languages. By providing examples in various languages, the project aims to demonstrate the similarities and differences in syntax and functionality, promoting cross-language understanding and exploration.

## Functionality

The built-in function in focus is [function name], which performs [briefly describe what the function does]. The function's implementation in different languages serves as a reference for developers looking to explore the language-specific nuances of this functionality.

## Languages

The function has been implemented in the following programming languages:

- Python
- JavaScript

Each language's implementation is organized in a separate directory within the repository, following the naming convention: `[language]/[method].[extension]`. For example, in the Python directory, you will find the file `python/method.py`.

## How to Use

To utilize the built-in function in a specific language, navigate to the respective language's directory and locate the corresponding file according to the naming convention mentioned above. Each file contains the implementation of the function in the respective language.

Refer to the README file inside each language directory for specific instructions on how to run the code and utilize the built-in function.
