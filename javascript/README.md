## JavaScript Implementation

### Prerequisites

To run the JavaScript implementation, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/source-code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `javascript` directory.

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_USERNAME/source-code/javascript
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

To use the custom "map" implementation in JavaScript, you can run the following command:

```bash
node map/map.js
```

### Testing

To run tests for the JavaScript implementations, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx jest
```

This assumes that you are using Jest as your testing framework. Adjust the command based on your actual test file names and locations.

### Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the JavaScript implementation, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/source-code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `javascript` directory.

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_USERNAME/source-code/javascript
    ```

3. Implement your changes or improvements in any JavaScript file, not limited to the "map" implementation.
4. Test your changes to ensure they work correctly.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request describing your changes and their purpose.
```

Replace "YOUR_USERNAME" with the actual username you want to use. This structure allows contributors to work on any JavaScript file within the `javascript` directory and not just the "map" implementation. Adjust the paths and names based on your actual project structure.
